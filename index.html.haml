            Longjohn is a software to manage studios and equipment for the

            We developed Healthety at K&auml;uferportal because we wanted
            to monitor the load from every server in realtime.
            %br
            And now we can use this tool on nearly any other number as
            well. Its so damn simple to add a chart that we now have like
            10 different reporters on about 20 machines reporting their
            numbers (load, memory, revenue, mail delivery, outgoing
            calls, db replica state, &hellip;).

            There is a big vision behind Soldat.js, we want to port

            to webgl. At the moment this repo is a playground to create a
            basic game and explore the possibilities. Besides from our
            main goal, we decided to use
            %a{href: 'http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script'}
              coffeescript
            just because we can.
