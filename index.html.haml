            %small Introduction
        %p
          I'm a 28 years old developer, living in Potsdam. I love
          getting things done, coding and more generally learning new
          stuff.
          %br
          Developing Rails webapplications is part of my life since 2007
          when I started to implement an online finance management
          software as a side project. Two years later it turned out to be
          way to complex for me and I abandoned it, but Rails is still
          there.
          %br
          I tried to create a decent overview about what I did the last
          years and hope you can get an impression.
          %br
          %br
          Have fun looking around!

            We developed Healthety at K&auml;uferportal because we wanted

            And now we can use this tool on nearly any other number as
            well. It's so simple to add a chart that we now have like
            10 different reporters on about 20 machines reporting their
            numbers (load, memory, revenue, mail delivery, outgoing
            calls, db replica state, &hellip;).
